Using a combination of @metric@ and @interval@ you can return a range of content extracted from a list. The results are ordered by most mentioned from the core list of @members@ in the @list@ as well as a set of 2nd degree users in the network.

The response is flexible in the structure depending on the @metric@ used and the source of the content.

Also included in the response is:
pre. start: 201302191417,
end: 201302191318,

@start@ and @end@ denote the time period of the requested analysis, controlled by @interval@.
